<h1>More convenient navigation</h1>

This update Pass for macOS add two new features to make the navigation more convenient. These reduce the need for a mouse significantly.

<h2>Cycle through search results</h2>
It is now possible to cycle through the search results. You can either use tab to cycle forward or shift-tab to cycle backward. This will also include the search field, i.e., you do not need your mouse anymore to get back to the search field.

<h2>Reset the state after the status bar popover closes</h2>
Now, every time the popover closes, e.g., because a password was chosen, the popover will be reset. This means that you don't have to use your mouse to get back to the search field for a new search, but you can just start typing.
